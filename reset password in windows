RESET FORGOTTEN PASSWORD IN WINDOWS:

Suppose you have a Windows 7 system repair disc or Windows 7 installation DVD in hand, you can access to Windows 7's System Recovery Options to repair Windows if a serious error occurs, including login password lost.

Start the locked computer and set the BIOS Setup to boot from CD/DVD disc. You can accomplish this by following the way we outlined in Step 2 in the first solution above.

Insert either your Windows 7 installation DVD or a Windows 7 System Repair disc into your optical drive and then restart the machine.
When a window appears, click the "Repair your computer" option at the lower left-hand corner.

Follow the steps until you reach the "System Recovery Options" screen, then select "Command Prompt" option. (You can also visit this link to learn how to open a command prompt.)
Type in the following command:

copy c:\windows\system32\utilman.exe c:\
copy c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe c:\windows\system32\utilman.exe

Now you can remove the disc and restart your machine.

Once you get to the Windows 7 logon screen, click the little icon that looks like a pie on the bottom-left corner and this will open Command Prompt window.
Now it's time to reset the password on Windows 7. 
Simply type the following command, replacing the username and newpassword with whatever user name and password you'd like to use:
net user username newpassword

add admin user from cmd:
net user /add logi logi123
net localgroup administrators logi /add
